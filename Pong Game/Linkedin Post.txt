ðŸŽ‰ Excited to share my latest project: Heramb's Pong Game! ðŸŽ®

I've built a classic Pong game using Python and Pygame, featuring:

Two-player gameplay
Special gadgets for each player
Real-time scoreboard and win screen
This project has been an incredible learning experience, enhancing my game development skills and understanding of event-driven programming.

Special thanks to the S.M.D.S YouTube channel for the amazing tutorials and guidance that helped me bring this project to life!

Check out the project on my GitHub and feel free to play and share your feedback!
